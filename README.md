# Project Keystroke

The aim of this project was to try and make a fully custom keybaord PCB that would replace the existing PCB in my obliterated 75 case from cannon keys.

## Goals

The project itself while straigh foreward does have some goals that i wanted to acheive. These are fatures i felt that were lacking from my current keyboard so i decided to make my own as a side roject and try to implement it.

-   Compatability with Khale Hot Swap Sockets.
-   Full USB-C Compatability
-   Support for QMK and VIA
-   possibility to implement wireless connectivity down the road.
